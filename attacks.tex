\chapter{Blockchain Attacks}

{\color{red}
\begin{itemize}
\item Probability of obtaining a block; the value $p$
\item Attacks of a majority miner
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Censoring transactions
    \item Double spending
    \item The impossibility of spending others' money
    \item The impossibility of breaking chain growth
    \end{itemize}
\item Healing from temporary dishonest majority
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Healing from censorship
    \item Temporarily rejecting payments: resilience to double spending attacks
    \end{itemize}
\item The expected block generation time $\frac{1}{f}$
\item Balancing the values $T$ and $k$
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Loss of security due to small $k$ and small $T$: variance attacks
    \item Loss of security due to large $k$ and large $T$: fan-out attacks
    \end{itemize}

\item Attacks of a minority miner
    \begin{itemize}
    \item The Selfish Mining attack
    \item Selfish Mining simulation and bounds for $1/3$ and $1/2$ adversaries
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
