\chapter{Attacking the Chain}

{\color{red}
\begin{itemize}
\item Probability of obtaining a block; the value $p$
\item Healing from temporary dishonest majority
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Healing from censorship
    \item Temporarily rejecting payments: resilience to double spending attacks
    \end{itemize}
\item The expected block generation time $\frac{1}{f}$
\item Balancing the values $T$ and $k$
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Loss of security due to small $k$ and small $T$: variance attacks
    \item Loss of security due to large $k$ and large $T$: fan-out attacks
    \end{itemize}
